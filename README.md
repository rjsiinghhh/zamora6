I have done many versions of this project, and all came to something I did not like or was proud of. Now I have a simplier version I want to accomplish. Simple in terms of the way it works, but just as complex. I want it to be a single page with a dashboard with many functions.

for this project I want to start with

-Login Page / Sign Up Page
(Login page will have .. NAME, ID )




-Dashboard
 (The dashboard will have everything on it.
    - Type,
    - Land Size,
    - Year created,
    - Daily Schedule,
    -  Yearly or Monthly Scheudle(What the workers are doing at the moment, where the orchard is on the yearly schduele... Thats the idea)
    -  Map,
    -  Problems on the site,
    -  Notes,
    -  Expected crop size,
    - Bills (monthly bills will be input and tracked to determine wether spending is going up or down)
    -  Sensors (Temperature in the are, Water pressure, things like that)
      *** Need to create the sesnors, I have the base for them but i need a few more pieces, for this project just get one of each to get the prototype up and going.   
     - Add a place for workers to chat??
     - These are just for the base of the project


    - The idea of this is to be a single page application with a dashboard on the left side that shows on the main. Like that chat application I finished this week, take the same principle or set up. If its going to be a large idea it has to be done in a simple manner.





- Start with making the login page.
